idea.jar necessary in IDEA JDK for PSI Elements (ASTWrapper...) to work correctly.

Notes on the Spec
=================
* The general rule is that everything gets hidden by everything when declared in different scopes.
  Defining the same name twice in the same scope results in a redeclaration error,
  regardless of declaration type (that is; structs, functions and variables).

  Exceptions: A variable declared with the same name as a function does not hide the function.
  The opposite is true for user defined types (structs). For example:
    float sin = sin(x); // is perfectly legal ...
    struct S { int x };
    S S = S(1.0);       // ... is not

Declarations
============
* Variables can be declared in:
  - the global scope
  - a parameter declaration
  - compound statements
  - for statements

Finding Declarations of Identifiers
===================================
Identifiers are found in three or four different places in the Psi not counting the declarations.
All these cases needs to be handled separately.
* identifier-expression (variable reference)
* function-call-expression (function reference)
* member-selection-expression (member reference)
* method-call-expression (method reference) <- currently only arrays have a length method
